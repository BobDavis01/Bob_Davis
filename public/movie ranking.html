<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<p>It's a movie about what it means to be black in both America and Africaâ€”and, more broadly, in the world. Rather than dodge complicated themes about race and identity, the film grapples head-on with the issues affecting modern-day black life.</p>
<br>
<h3>Titanic (1997)</h3>
<p>James Cameron's "Titanic" is an epic, action-packed romance set against the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic; the pride and joy of the White Star Line and, at the time, the largest moving object ever built.</p>
<br>
<h3>Payback</h3>
<p>Payback is a true crime documentary series that profiles stories of revenge, told through gripping interviews with the family members, community members, and law enforcement who experienced the events firsthand.</p>
